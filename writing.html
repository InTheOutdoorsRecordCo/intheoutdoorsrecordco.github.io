    <p id="essay">IT RAINS MORE THAN IT SNOWS EVEN IN WINTER. HUMID VALLEY ATMOSPHERE TRAPS THE HEAT YEAR ROUND MAKING FOR A LONG WET SEASON. A MIX OF FEVER AND DESIRE AND APATHY AND HAZE SHOWERS DRAMATIC CLOUDS AND GORGEOUS SUNSETS AFTER STORMS BLOW THROUGH. COLLEGE KIDS MAKE THEIR MONEY AND THE BUSINESSES LAY BAIT FOR THEIR RETURN CUSTOMERS. IRON FENCE GATES ON THE BLOCKS NEAR CAMPUS VICTORIAN GARDEN WEEPING WILLOW BODEGA FAMILY BAR. UP TOWN TOWARD THE RIVER FRONT THE EXPENSIVE WHISKEY ROW RENOVATED FACADE DISTRICT BUT ALSO BRUNCH AND ART GALLERIES. GUESTS HERE SURE DO LOVE OUR SOUTHERN CHARM AND GOOD NATURED HUMOR. WHAT BUILT THE GIANT DISTILLERIES DOWNTOWN WE KNOW WELL WERE PEOPLE OF COLOR. WE KNOW THE DARK HISTORY OF THE CITY AND THE STATE AS WELL AS WE KNOW THE PILGRIMS CAME FROM THE MAYFLOWER. COTTON AND TOBACCO BEFORE WHISKEY AND CANNABIS. BLACK PEOPLE EXIST AS THE POOR AND WORKING CLASS SOCIETY & WHITE MEN THINK THEY’RE GOD BECAUSE A WHITE MAN WROTE IT IN A BOOK FEW HUNDRED YEARS AGO. CIGS ARE THE WORST AND YET A WONDERFUL LITTLE ESCAPE AREN’T THEY? MAKE YOU SICK TO YOUR STOMACH WITH NAUSEA AND YELLOW YOUR TEETH AND DECAY YOUR GUMS BUT SMELL BAD TOO. A REMNANT OF THE PAST LABOR WORKING SOCIETY AND EARLY MODERN MEDICINE. OF PROHIBITION SO STATES FACING THE FEDERAL LIQUOR BAN COULD STILL EXPORT TOBACCO. A LITTLE BREAK IS ALL IT IS. A LITTLE BREAK TO FORGET YOUR TROUBLES AND SLOWLY KILL YOURSELF. TO SUCCUMB TO THE EMPIRE OF CAPITALISTIC ABUSE THAT HAS REIGNED FOR MILLENNIA. AMERICA DIDN’T INVENT THE FREE MARKET AND SURE AS HELL THE FOUNDING FATHERS DIDN’T CONCEIVE OF COMMERCE. NO SIRE THAT IS 100% EUROPEAN BORN PHILOSOPHY INDEED. JUST LIKE ALL THE STUFF WE’VE GROWN TO RELY ON - OIL AND FATS WINE CHEESE IRON STEEL WOOD CLOTHES SHOES VODKA AND SPACESHIPS. TELEVISION MOVIES AND POP STARS ARE OUR BIGGEST EXPORTS ELSE NOVELTIES LIKE BOOKS AND HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS REBRANDED FOR SALE INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS WHEAT CORN SOY ALL IMPORTANT AS WELL. MAYBE NOT SO MUCH AS TEXAS OIL, DUG EARTH MINERALS, INCLUDING URANIUM, THOUGH. THE LAND ON WHICH WE STAND THE AIR THAT WE BREATHE. GOD FORBID PEOPLE MUST COME TO WORK IN THE STATES EVEN FOR A MEASLY MINIMUM WAGE. CLINGING TO WHAT FREEDOM THEY DON’T HAVE ELSEWHERE FROM OPPRESSIVE REGIMES AND JOB AND FOOD SCARCITY. SOMEONE HAS TO FLIP BURGERS AND RESTOCK THE SHELVES AT BIG BOX STORES AND FIX COMPUTERS

    I WISH FOR A NORMAL REALITY - ONE NOT RULED BY THE DRAMA OF LIVING AT THE END OF TIMES NAUGHT ABIDE THE CHRISTIAN REVELATION VERSE OF TWENTIETH CENTURY PREDICATION THAT BINDS US WITH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES TOWARDS A REGIME DARKEST THAN SEEN IN A CENTURY BUT FEAR NOT FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM IS PAVED WITH CITIZENRY OF COLLECTIVE STRENGTH THE BELIEF THAT WE ARE ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE GREAT WAY TOWARD CHANGE AND THAT TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY ENLIGHTENMENT IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER ONLY WE ALSO REMEMBER THE TURN OF THE MILLENNIUM WHICH BTW WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO AND IF THINGS DON’T LOOK AS DARK NOW AS THEY WERE THEN THEN MAYBE WE WOULDN’T SEE THE LIGHT SHINED UP OUR ASSES UNLESS WE WERE TOTALLY UPSIDE DOWN. IF THE WORLD IS TRULY DIVIDED IN HALF MORALLY WITH OBJECTIVE TRUTH HAVING A YES OR NO ANSWER (WHICH WE ALL KNOW IS FALSE) THEN WHO CAN RIGHTLY ASSUME THAT ANYONE APPEALING TO THE WHOLE HAS EVERYONE’S BEST INTERESTS AT HEART? TRULY CHRISTLIKE IN THEIR WELCOMING OF ALL SOULS WHO’VE SINNED, EH? WE SEEM TO NEGLECT THE FACT THAT EVERYONE’S LIVES ARE FULL OF CHOICES EVERY DAY AND IF EACH ONE OF THEM IS HANGING THE ENTIRETY OF MANKIND ON JOE SMITH’S ABILITY TO PRESS A BUTTON THAT GIVES SOMEONE A DOLLAR DOESN’T THAT JUST LESSEN THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL THE MURDER SUICIDES AND POLICE BRUTALITY THAT WE CAN’T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING TO FIX BUT VOTE AGAINST IN FAVOR OF ANOTHER WHITE LIBERAL TO BURY THE LEDE ON THE ISSUE? NO HOPE CAN CONQUER THE LACK OF MORAL INSIGHT THESE ASSHOLES CARRY FORWARD ON A DAILY BASIS SUBSTITUTING THE WRONG IDEALS FOR THE TRUE WILL OF THE MASSES. THE GREAT DISPERSION HAS BEGUN IN THE SECOND DECADE OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY. A BREAKUP OF INDIVIDUALS AND IMPOSED IDEALS. WE REALIZE NOW WE CAN GO OUR OWN WAY AND BE ORGANIZED BY BEING REAL HUMAN BEINGS WITH A BEATING HEART. NOT DRONES FOR A SIDE WITH A VALUE MAJORITY THEY WILL CAPITALIZE ON AD INFINITUM.

    BUCKY LAID IX EGYPTIAN GYM TEAMS  BEFORE THE BATTLER CEASED. WARF SHOT BANG! TRASH CANNED. DOWN ROAD NOBODY CARED AS EAST BENT FORWARD AT LEISURE. I LOVED HER I AM SURE. NIGHTS IN COLD PLEASANT STRATUS & CRAB CAKES AT STAND WE BOUGHT TO FILL US. POSTER SHOWED A WEATHER VAN SCENE ABOUT GUITAR GOD I CAUGHT. ORANGE CAM LIT EYE HACKED AT THE WEEDS UNTIL SHE TORUS HIMSELF. COST ADMIT TICKET WARNED OF STORY TURBULENCE. SIGHT I SAW WAS OF MY LOVE DRESSED AND ALIVE YET DEAD. CEMETERY BAR VOTED BAIL SO WE LEFT FOR XMAS CURBS. ELI GAVE BIRD A BAKED CRUMB ON THE CARPET. TV STEREO JANGLED BAD MUSIC COMFORT BEST SUITED FOR SAD BABIES. MOON GIFTED BOY BLESSING I AND YOU. STILL MELANCHOLIC THEY WENT TO BED. QUIET NEIGHBORS AND SILENT STREET MUSIC PLAYED LOUD FOR CARS AND POLICE, SIRENS TIL MORNING, SO MUCH COFFEE AND FAKE WORK. GAME MADE ME POUT FOR ABBOTT MISSING CHURCH WHICH SENT ME BACK TO THE TREES. WAITS IN RECLINE WHILST SETTLING IT TRACKS HIM. NO FUTURE CAN OCCUR WITHOUT VISION. PLANS TO MOVE SOUTH OR WEST ONLY MAKE STRESS WORSEN. SAFER TO STAY PUT? NO GAIN WITHOUT CAUSE. A RABBIT HOLE. A CELLAR DOOR. LIFE IN THE BURROW BURNED WICK'S END. A TEN OR 15 YEAR REUNION NEVER DID. ADVENT OF TIME LOST SPUR SEASONS OF BALANCE DUE OLD CABIN CALLING TO ESCAPE CITY DWELLING. MUST GET FREE MUST SLOW DOWN ONLY CANT. THE AGE MUST RESOLVE. NOW ONLY NEW THINGS GROW LIKE CANCER. DAY LIGHT BUSINESS OF DEATH AND ABUSIVE ORDER. NIGHTS THAT NEVER SATISFIED. EACH MOURNING WE FEEL THE WEIGHT OF GUILT NOT PARTICIPATED IN. A SAVING GRACE WISHED HIM FREE. A POST THAT MADE NO SENSE AND LABORED FOR A PERSPECTIVE. IF THERE WAS AN EASY PATH SURELY IT WAS LONG SPOILED. YES THE HOURS MADE THEM WEEPY. ANGEL CHILD TELL MOM SHE CAN DO IT. SHE HERSELF HAD SIGHT FOR A TIME. SWEPT UP IN HER OWN MOTHER’S CONCERN. I WILL LEAD MYSELF MY VECTOR TO NOTHING. IF HAPPINESS EXISTS IT IS NEVER FOREVER. IT IS A RARE FEEL TO BE RECORDED AND CHERISHED. A TICKLE OF CHILDHOOD FREEDOM THAT MADE HER LAUGH AGAIN AND AGAIN. A PLAY TIME NEVER ENDING. COOKED FOOD. A FALSE REALITY SHE BELIEVED THAT SHE WAS UNLOVED BUT I DID FOREVER BEFORE AND AFTER. SO THEN SONGS ABOUT FLIGHT SO SHE CAN FLY HOME. I’D DIE TO KNOW WHERE IT IS. AND SO WOULD SHE. TRANSIENT HOTEL ROOM ARCHITECTURE MADE TO FEEL LIKE HOME. WIND SAYS TIME TO FLY TO WHERE WE LAND. FIGHT OR FLIGHT. WE DON’T CHOOSE. A HOUSE FOR US IS HOME. OR A FOREST. OR BOTH. I COULD TELEPORT US TO A HOT TUB IN THE WOODS WITH A FIRE PIT AND SCENIC LAKE VIEWS BUT THE PHYSICAL TRAUMA OF MOVING TWO BODIES THROUGH SPACE AND TIME TO REASSEMBLE PERFECTLY AT SAID LOCALE IS BEYOND IMPROBABLE. WE ARE ABOUT TO BRAVE THE WINTER ALONE AS A COUPLE MARRIED HOW LONG? FIVE YEARS OF PARTNERSHIP IS NOTHING TO SOMEONE WHO HAS MET THE ONE WHO WILL CHANGE THEIR LIFE FOREVER. WE COULD LIVE IN ENGLAND OR NORWAY OR SWEDEN IN A COTTAGE ON A WINDY HILL NEAR THE FOREST WITH A MEADOW OF ALPACA WE KEEP AS FAMILY AND SHEAR FOR WOOL. MAGIC GROWS UNDERGROUND A NETWORK OF MYCELIUM THRIVING ON THE BODIES OF THE DEAD AND CREATING ITSELF AS FRUIT FOR US AND ANIMALS. COLD DAYS CALL FOR HOT SOUP AND BEEF BUT ALSO PIES AND CHOCOLATE. FIREPLACE DANCING TO THE SONG OF BRIGID INSTILLING WARMTH AND BRAVERY IN OUR SOULS.

    RACISM SEEPS OUT FROM ALL CORNERS OF THE WORLD WHEN NO BODY IS PRESENT TO FACE IT. BESIDES EVENTS THAT DISTRACT FROM THE DIVISION OF BLACK & WHITE AND DO MORE TO HIGHLIGHT FALSE HARMONY IN THE TRIBES OF THE VALLEY, HERE THERE IS NO SENSE OF THE GREATER MUNICIPAL WORK TOWARDS MAKING LIFE MORE BEARABLE FOR THE LOWER CLASS. GROSS FRATERNAL LANDSCAPE FOR LOCALS ONLY TO STARVE BEFORE THE KINGDOM OF FAST CASUAL THIRD WAVE HIPSTER CHIC BBQ HOUSES AND BOURBON ON TAP. TOURISTS WHO HAVE COME FOR FOOD AND DRINK AND A SHOW OH ABSOLUTELY. A GAME AND A PARTY. WHEN DAILY NEWS BREAKS OF ABANDONED CHILDREN AND TORTURED WOMEN IN THE BEDROOMS NEXT DOOR. BY THE COWARDS IN OFFICE THE BIG SWINGING DICK OF THE STATE BOYS RAISED ON BLUE SYRUP FOR THE WHITES ONLY SODA FOUNTAINS FROM NASHVILLE TO CINCINNATI. ID EAT A STICK BUT HIGHER SELF SAID NOT FUNNY SO BREAD AND WATER WILL LAST ME AN HOUR HERE IN THE FOOD DESERT OF THE WEST. KROGER AT LEAST KNOWS THE EAGLE TALON GRIP IT HOLDS ON THE FAMILIES AROUND HERE. ANYWAY… SO WE GROW OUR OWN FOOD. ANYTHING. YOU NAME IT. GARDEN OF COMMUNAL SUSTENANCE VEGETABLES HERBS LETTUCE FRUITS BERRIES AND MUSHROOMS FORAGED FROM THE FOREST A STONES THROW AWAY. NOT THE WOODS BY THE APARTMENTS A REAL FOREST. TREES IN KENTUCKY ARE EVERYWHERE. PEOPLE ARE BORN AND RAISED IN THE FOREST AND IN THE WOODS. SUPPOSE THATS ANY STATE IN AMERICA SAVE FOR THE TROPICS AND COASTAL NEUTRALIAN UTOPIAS WITH PERFECT WEATHER. RURAL KIDS KNOW HOW TO MAKE A MEAL FROM SCRATCH JUST LIKE THEIR GRANDDADS. I LEARNED HOW TO COOK FROM A BOX FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS PAY CLOSE ATTENTION PROCESSED FOOD SOMETIMES FACSIMILE TO A LEGITIMATE MEAL. MOSTLY ATE MCDONALDS OR SOMETHING DAD MADE TRYING OUT A NEW RECIPE HE’D FOUND ONLINE WAS A MEAT AND MOM MADE VEGETABLES. OUR HOUSE WAS ABUNDANT IN THINGS TO EAT ONCE I WAS OLDER AND BACK FROM SCHOOL. TASTE EXPLODED IN COLLEGE IN CINCI WHEN I BECAME AN INDIAN FOOD ADDICT AND WHEN MEDITERRANEAN SOFTENED BY THE MIDWEST WAS COMFORT. BREAKFAST BOWL MAYBE A COFFEE OR THREE CINNAMON CREAM BUTTERED TOAST. A THEATRE OF FOODS LIKE CARNIVAL A REVOLVING DOOR OF BRICK AND MORTAR POP UP GASTRO EXPERIMENTS OR RATHER STARTUPS THAT KNOW FOOD SELLS HERE. I BUY A HORCHATA CUZ ITS AROUND THE HOLIDAYS SERVED ICED I MAKE SURE THE HEAT IS ON IN THE HOUSE AND WOOL SOCKS.

    IN AN AGE WHEN 1 OUT OF 10 MEN IS A SEXUAL ABUSER ... TO EVEN WRITE THAT SENTENCE IS THE WORST OF THE TRUTHS OF OUR SOCIETY IN 2023 I IMAGINE ... MEANS THAT TO BE A MAN WHO AIMS TO HAVE ANY RESPECT AT ALL FROM WOMEN - REAL, NOT SUBSERVIENT, OR GODLY PRAISE - IS NOTHING IF BUT A SISYPHYIAN, AND YES THE IMPLICATION OF A SISSY IS NOT BY ANY MEANS UNIMPLICATED. THE WOMEN IN THE WORLD WHO AREN'T RAISED TO LIVE IN FEAR OF MEN COULD HAVE A PROFOUD EFFECT ON CHANGING AMERICAN SOCIETY IF WE CARED ANYTHING ABOUT BEING UP TO STANDARD WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD. IN AMERICA THE WOMEN WHO AREN'T FULLY UNDER THE RADICALIZATION OF THE CHRISTIAN PARTIARCHAL GOVERNMENT ARE DEMONIZED FOR EXPRESSING THEIR INDIVIDUALISM AND FEMINITY AS IF SOMETHING PRETTY IN A LANDFILL NEEDS TO BE REMOVED TO NOT DISTURB THE FILTH. NOBODY IS ALLOWED TO CELEBRATE WOMEN EVEN THE ONES WHO SAVE LIVES AND LIBERATE TOWNS AND STATES. WE HAVE BUILT THIS FRAGILE VIEW OF WOMEN IN THE LAST  CENTURY WITH THE INVENTION OF MODERN ADVERTISING & HOLLYWOOD AND MOST RECENTLY FASHION REALITY TELEVISION AND POP MUSIC AND BY 2023 THE DEGRADATION OF WOMEN IS AS COMMONPLACE AS MCDONALD'S. THE BLOSSOMING OF POWERFUL WOMEN FIGHTING THE MONUMENTAL AND  PROFOUNDLY MYSOGINISTIC INSTITUTIONS OF THE WORLD THAT BY BEING INTRINSICALLY EVIL AND ABUSIVE ARE HINDERING PROGRESS IN SOCIETY IS SOMETHING TO BEHOLD IN THIS MOMENT OF HISTORY. I AM OF THE BELIEF THAT ALL WOMEN WORKING TOGETHER IS A GOOD THING FOR THE PROGRESS OF SOCIETY BECAUSE THEY LOOK OUT FOR THE GOOD OF OTHERS BY NATURE. AND THE MATTER OF "ME TOO" ADRESSING THE ISSUE AND NEW PERPETRATORS COMING TO LIGHT EACH DAY IS ONLY ECLIPSED BY THE MACHINE PERPETUALLY HIDING CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN AND ATTACKING THEM IN THE MEDIA. THE SHROUD THAT MEN ARE ABLE TO KEEP OVER WOMEN IN A HOLOCENE AND NOW ANTHROPOCENE BY MERELY DOMINATING ALL ASPECTS OF CAPITALISM IS CLEAR AS DAY AND WE AS MEN WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO NOT HARM WOMEN SHOULD STAND IN FRONT OF THEM AND NOT BEHIND THEM.

    ISN’T CORPORATE NETWORKING FUN? LET’S APPLY THAT SAME ENERGY BUT TO GRASSROOTS MOVEMENTS AND SOCIALIST WORKS HUH? THE PANDEMIC SORT OF DREW A LINE IN THE SAND ON MANY ISSUES. AND THEY REALLY COME DOWN TO EVERYONE AGREEING ON THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS. BUT A SILENTLY GROWING MAJORITY OF LIKEMINDED THINKERS BEGAN TO FEEL A SENSE OF PROSPERITY IN EXPRESSING DISTRUST AND FRUSTRATION AT THE CURRENT STATES OF MANY AFFAIRS. I MYSELF SHOULD NOW INVENTORY MY OWN AFFAIRS AS ONE SHOULD DO OFTEN AND WITH RESPECT TO THE UNKNOWN BUT NOT SO MUCH THAT THEY LOSE THE FOREST FOR THE TREES AS IT WERE. I RESORT BACK TO THE SUM OF MY ASSETS AND THEIR IMPORTANCE TO MY WELL BEING AND SURVIVAL THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH BEING OUR PETS WHOSE SINGULAR SURVIVAL AND WELL BEING I PUT ABOVE MY OWN PLAYING THE MANY PARTS OF A FATHER AND THE SECOND BEING MY WIFE WHO IS ALL THE LIGHT IN MY LIFE. ELSE HER AS PRIMARY AND THEN OUR PETS WHICH IF THEY ARE HERS THEN SHE AND THEM AND ME. THE REST OF MY TOMB IS BOOKS GUITARS RECORDS OLD FAMILY TREASURES FROM GREAT GRAND POP’S FACTORY SWEATERS SNEAKERS AND A LAPTOP. IF I SAID I HAD A SAVINGS ACCOUNT IT WOULD BE A LIE. I MANAGED TO BUY STOCK WITH A BIT OF THE INHERITANCE AUNT KAREN MANAGED TO SECURE FROM GRANDPA JIM’S ESTATE. I RESEARCH THE MARKET AND READ INVESTMENT ARTICLES WATCHING THE LITTLE DOLLARS MOVE BY PENNIES EVERYDAY. MAKING ART OR RATHER EXPENDING CREATIVITY IS SOMETHING I HAVE MANAGED TO FOCUS FOR THE MOST PART IN MY FOURTH DECADE ALIVE. WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND MORE EXCITABLE THE THRILL OF CREATING SOMETHING NEW WAS MORE OF A HYPER FIXATION FOR ME. I HAD ADORED ALL THE CREATORS OF THE PAST - THOUGH NAMING WHITE MEN WHO MADE THEIR NAMES OFF RACIST CARTOONS IS HARDLY SOMETHING I WISH TO DO HERE. NO THE GROWING CONCERN HERE OF COURSE IS FOR THE SURVIVAL OF THE ARTS AS WELL AS THE MANY RACES OF CITIZENS WHOS BACKS WE TOIL UPON EVERYDAY. THE STATE BROKE AT THE RIOTS WHEN RACISM WAS PUT AT THE FOREFRONT OF THE MEDIA AND THE POLITICAL RACE. THE JEWISH AND MUSLIM POPULACES STRUGGLE TO KEEP THEIR HEADS ABOVE THE BOILING SURFACE OF HYPOCRISY AND ANTISEMITISM ROOTED IN THE SAME VIOLENCE OF THE WHITE EUROPEAN CAPITALIST EMPIRE THAT PRODUCES THE NETFLIX SERIES ABOUT THE DRAMA WHILST SIMULTANEOUSLY RUNNING WRITERS AND ACTORS OUT OF THE JOB. WE ARE TREES ON A ROCK FACE CLINGING TO THE MOUNTAIN OF JUSTICE WHILE THE WINDS OF DESTRUCTION SHAKE OUR NEEDLES AND BREAK OUR LIMBS. OUR GROWTH POTENTIAL IS MINIMAL HERE BUT IF WE CAN SUSTAIN OUR OWN LIVES MAYBE WE CAN ALSO GIVE TO AND ASSIST THE COLLECTIVE. LIFE IS THE WAY FORWARD LIFE THE GIVER OF ALL THINGS LIFE THE SWEETEST KISS OF ALL AND THE REASON FOR WHICH WE ARE ON THIS EARTH. THE WORST THING ANY BODY CAN DO IS BECOME APATHETIC TOWARDS THE HORRORS OF THE WORLD AND TOWARDS INJUSTICE. EVEN AS WE WAKE UP AND MAKE COFFEE AND SIT IN DESK CHAIRS AND SHOP FOR CLOTHES AND EAT PIZZA AND DRINK COKE WE MUST CHOOSE THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY AND ACT WITH CONSCIENCE.

    I OPEN THE FRIDGE; RASPBERRY JAM WITH SEEDS EYE SPY AT FIRST WITH MY TONGUE SWEET & TART BUT SEEDS IN TEETH SO REDIRECT OVER TOWARD THE GREENS MAYBE CELERY JUICE? ALL THE FADS OF BRANDING COME TO MIND. ADD SOME LEMON THOUGH AND GAME CHANGED. GO FOR BREAKFAST SAUSAGE BIG CITY ONE SPICY BUT HEAVY IN STOMACH. EGGS ON EGGS COULD BE GOOD. CHAMPIONS KNOW? SWEET CRAB DIP FOR FOOTBALL GAME LATER AND EXTRA KOMBUCHA, FIZZY. IVE GOT MAD CHICKEN WITH EGG NOODLES AND RAD GUMBO FROM NEW ORLEANS. BETTER TO EXPERIENCE VARIATION IN A DIET USING FRESH INGREDIENTS BOUGHT RECENTLY THAN PROCESSED AND PACKAGED DERIVATIVE "CRAFT" FOODS (EVERYTHING IS THESE DAYS) AS ALL THE NUTRITIONISTS AND FOODIES KNOW. CHICKEN FOR DAYS IF YOU DO IT RIGHT. DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT SPENDING A DIME AT A FAST FOOD PLACE ON DAYS CALLING FOR CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP. SWEET YAMS COULD DO ME RIGHT AS WELL CASSEROLED WITH BROWN SUGAR AND MARSHMALLOW. CUCUMBER MELON AGUA FRESCO TO QUENCH THIRST AND A NORI SNACK WE ALL LOVE. BERRIES AND CREAM SMOOTHIE WITH CHIA FOR DESSERT. 
    <br><br>
    PUB LIT CITY SAKE HOUR. GOLD LICENSE PLATE HANGING ON THE WALL. COLORED HAIR AND ORANGE PEELS. DANCE POOL INDIE POP & SPRING ROLL. AYE DRAGON THE MAN LEFT THE TABLE FOR A SMOKE. PASSING CARS LATE PRE-DAWN. IVE RESERVED A TABLE FOR 6 AT THE INDIAN TO EAT SQUID DUNKED IN SPICY OIL FOR A FAMILY CELEBRATION. SURF WOKE THE BEAST WET WITH DANGER AND UPSEXXED TO OBLIVION. HOT PINK WEATHER BLOWS IN ROCK FOR SHADE I THINK BUT THE SIDEWALK FEELS GOOD ON MY BARE FEET. LATER POOLS RUMOURED TO BE RIPE WITH CELEBRITY AND MILLZ MADE AN APPEARANCE. I HANG FOR A MOVIE NEW AND SAD ABOUT A VICE I HOLD ON MY FRIENDS AGO. HIBISCUS FLOWER REMINDS US THAT HAWAII IS FOR THE NATIVES. A LOCAL GIRL WAITS FOR AN UBER WHILE ANOTHER FRIEND EATS ICE CREAM. I LIVE FOR MY MORNING COFFEE & NEWS AND PALM TREES. ALWAYS TRACKING THESE DAYS BUT HOPING FOR GROUP THERAPY. PUNK ARCADIANS AT DUSK LIKE MY FATHER ARE TOO MUCH FOR A TRANSPLANT. I COMMUNE AND TYPE FOR A LIVING MOSTLY ON THE WEB BUT SOMETIMES THERE'S AN ART THAT MAKES ME SOME CHANGE. ROMANO IS A JOKE THAT WE TALK ABOUT ON THE RADIO BUT THE THYME DOESN'T LIE. THE GAME IS NOW A VIDEO SINCE WE FEEL CLOSE ENOUGH TO LET THE FLICKER REST OUR BURNT EYES. MIDNIGHT IN THE SAND WILL LEAD TO OUR DESIRE TO BE EACH OTHER. JOINTS AND LONG PULLS KEEP US DRINKING LESS BUT THE SUPPLY IS RUNNING LOW. YALK TO A LIZ WHO HAS THE PLUG FOR LOCALS AND KEEPS US HUMBLE. TRADE SKYSCRAPERS FOR REACHING RESORTS AND HOTELS SKY GLITTER DISNEY DANCE FOR A FLUTTER KISS THE MOONLIGHT SURE AS DESTINY. FISH IS FINE SKATING ON SUNSHINE AND MYSTERY GIGGLES A BLOCK AWAY. CLOUDS ARE TOO MUCH BEAUTY FOR MY PAINTER IN MIND. STILL PLACES TO SEEK KNOWING EMOTION IS THE JOURNEY & WE BELONG WITH EACH OTHER. RELAX IN A DECENT CHAIR TO A BACKYARD FIRE THINKING OF GERMAN WOODS SOME THOUSANDS OF LEAGUES AWAY. HER RESEARCHING THESE DAYS AND SNOW STICKING TO MY EYELASHES AS HER BODY COMES BACK. WE LIVE HERE NOW IF ONLY FOR A SHORT WHILE SINCE THERE IS AMPLE TIMES FOR NATURE TO DECIDE OUR PATH.

    I USED TO HIKE THE LUDLOW DISTRICT IN CINCINNATI EVERY MORNING BEFORE FRESHMAN ACTING CLASS. I'D WALK UP LORAINE AVE AND PASS CLOSE TO THE MARBURG HOTEL BEFORE CROSSING LUDLOW ST AND HEADING THROUGH THE PARK. I WOULD WALK AROUND THE POND LISTENING TO MUSIC AND FINALLY MAKE MY WAY UP THE LONG STEPS AT THE END OF CAMPUS. IT WAS TOO LONG OF A WALK EVERY MORNING SO MOST NIGHTS I WOULD CRASH AT THE DORMS WITH MY CLASSMATES. I MOVED TO CLIFTON WITH 3 CLASSMATES SOPHOMORE YEAR TO THE HOUSE ON LYON ST NEXT TO THE STOP-N-GO AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LARGE UNDEVELOPED LOT NEAR SCHOOL. WE HAD RENTED THE HOUSE AFTER THE PREVIOUS ACTING STUDENTS WHO LIVED THERE, ALL WOMEN, WHO HAD NAMED IT "THE DOLL HOUSE" AND IT HAD BEEN KNOWN TO BE COZY AND WELCOMING TO ALL CCM ARTISTS. WE MADE IT OUR OWN. I TOOK THE FIRST ROOM UPSTAIRS WITH AN ANGLED ROOF; TY TOOK THE NEXT ROOM SMALLER AND DORMISH; AND JACK TOOK THE LAST ROOM WHICH WAS DOUBLE THE SIZE OF OURS THOUGH HE WAS LARGER (WE USED THIS TO JUSTIFY) FACING LYON ST; WE GAVE WILL THE MASSIVE ALMOST FULL SUITE BEDROOM ON THE GROUND FLOOR AS HE IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE KING AMONG US, AND IS THE BIGGEST BOY ON THE PLANET. WE LIVED THERE FOR TWO YEARS, THROUGH 8 SEASONS. ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS TO DO WAS GO TO THE OVERLOOK PARK AT THE END OF OHIO ST. IT WAS REALLY THE BEST VIEW OF CINCINNATI'S SKYLINE IN THE WHOLE CITY. I HAD SEVERAL MEMORABLE SITS AND TALKS ON THE CURVED CONCRETE BENCH. 
    <br><br>
    CLOUDS ABOVE MY HOUSE LIT UP AT HALF LIGHT; TELEPHONE POLE WITH GREY BOX HAS THREE BIRDS SITTING LOOKING DOWN; CARS PASS BOTH WAYS MOSTLY HARMLESS; THE PARK IS SERENE AND DISTANT; PEOPLE SIT ON THEIR PORCHES WATCHING OTHERS PASS AS THE SUN SETS; THE NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE STREET HAS AN ASTROTURF PORCH; THEIR NEIGHBOR NEXTDOOR HAS AN OVERGROWN WISTERIA TREE;
    <br><br>
    AVERAGE CITIZENS EVEN THE KIND WHO SHOP AT HIGH SCALE GROCERY STORES AND HOLD VICE PRESIDENTIAL CORPORATE JOBS DO NOT HOLD ANY - ZERO ZILCH - POWER ABOVE THE GOVERNMENT OR THE CORPORATION THEY WORK FOR OR THE CHURCH THEY ATTEND. THEY AGREE TO ENTER CONTRACT WITH AN ENTITY OF POWER IN EXCHANGE FOR ANYTHING AT ALL EXCEPT FOR SPECIFICALLY USURPING ANY OF THE POWER HELD BY THE ENTITY THEY HAVE AGREED TO BE EMPLOYED BY. WHEN LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE CAN AGREE TO TAKE ON A POWERFUL ENTITY, SOMETIMES THEY CAN WIN THE FIGHT. BUT ONLY IF THEIR CONVICTIONS AND ORGANIZERS ARE BETTER EQUIPPED TO HOLD THE POWER THEY INTENT TO TAKE FROM THE ENTITY. EVERY BASIC ASS WHITE PERSON THINKS THEY “HAVE POWER” WHICH IS NOT TRUE; WHAT THEY POSSESS IS PRIVILEGE WHICH IS BEING TREATED BETTER THAN SOMEONE ELSE. CORPORATE POWER IS NOT EVEN POWER. POWER IS HELD BY THE GOVERNMENT. IT’S THE POWER TO SEND YOU TO PRISON. IT’S THE POWER TO SEND YOU BACK TO ANOTHER COUNTRY. WHAT AN INDIVIDUAL THINKS THEIR POWER IS ACTUALLY IS NOTHING WITHOUT MANY MORE PEOPLE SUPPORTING THEIR CAUSE. A MAN WITH A GUN IS NOT POWER IT’S COWARDICE. AND WE KNOW THERE’S HIERARCHY IN AMERICAN PRIVILEGE BUT WHAT THE PRIVILEGED IGNORE IS THAT BY MAKING THEMSELVES MORE INDIVIDUALLY PROTECTED AND PROFITING THEY ARE ACTUALLY GIVING UP THEIR POWER TO THE ENTITIES THEY CLAIM ARE PROTECTING THEM. BUT PROTECTING THEM FROM WHAT? WOULD THEY NOT TURN ON AN INDIVIDUAL TO PRESERVE THE COLLECTIVE ENTITY? SO EVEN BY GAINING CORPORATE POWER AS AN INDIVIDUAL YOU ARE CONTRACTUALLY AGREEING TO RELINQUISH YOUR POWER TO THE ENTITY THAT EMPLOYS OR “PROTECTS” YOU.
    <br><br>
    TRACTOR GIVES SENSE OF PRODUCTION FOR THE COMPANY WITH THE BIG CONTRACT. EXPENSIVE KID SPORTS BEFORE QUESTING TO HIGH MOUNTAIN VISTAS LED TO AN ABUNDANCE OF SOCK. HOUSE FRONTS TOO CLOSE BY COUNTRY FARM STANDARDS. CASINO PORTRAITS IN THE LODGE SCREAM MILLER TIME FOR GRANDPA. PIANO TWINKLE. SHOPS THAT CLOSE EARLY BUT HAVE SORTS OF TREASURE. A BACKYARD WALKOUT TO A SMALL PARTY AROUND A BONFIRE BY THE FIELD. THERE IS ALWAYS THE WOODS. HIDDEN POND THEY STOCK FULL EVERY SEASON. GROVE MADE BY MOTHER NATURE. AVOID THE RADIO SURE SIGN OF THE TIMES, BUT MAYBE AN OLD COUNTRY TUNE, SOME BUTT ROCK MIXED IN. DOGS IN THEIR HOME ZONE YARDS BUT ALWAYS WANDERING AROUND. LATITUDE DOES NOT KNOW OF TEXAS BUT THE WIND DOES AND SO DO THE CITIZENS OF RURAL TOWN INDIANA. 
    <br><br>
    ANNIE, THE PLAY OF ERRORS MUST NOT BE SHOWN, OR ELSE A HORROR SHOW OF MYTHICAL PROPORTIONS WILL HEAR US ARRANGING THE NOTES OF OUR ESCAPE AGAIN. CHANGING MINDS IS HER VOCATION, BUT SHATTERING THEM IS THE FIRST STEP. 
    THERE MUST BE NO WILHELM SCREAM FROM THE STREET, NO ALARMS. ONLY THE SINGING OF BIRDS AND THE GIGGLES OF CHILDREN. WE WILL LEAVE THIS PLACE WITH OUR NIGHTMARE IN A GLASS JAR, OUR GHOSTS SWEPT FROM THE ATTIC WILL FOLD THEMSELVES IN BOXES. WE WILL TELL THE STORY OF OUR YOUNG MARRIAGE OF WHEN WE BRAVELY FACED THE ODDS, AND HOW OUR FAMILIES LASHED OUT AT THEIR SAD LIVES AGAINST US. THE MIRROR OF AMERICAN GENERATIONS WHERE ABUSE IS PASSED DOWN AS INHERITANCE MUST BE BROKEN, AND WE WILL START WITH SEPARATION FROM THE HERD. NO MOTHERS TO SALT OUR WOUNDS AND BRIBE US INTO THEIR LIVES WITH TREATS AND FAKE SMILES. THE CARNIVAL OF THREATS IS FINALLY OVER, MAKE WAY FOR THE HAYRIDE OF PRIDE AND SHAME. THE SISTERS ARE JEALOUS OBVIOUSLY THAT WE HAVE NO CHILDREN, WHICH BY ALL ENTIRE MEANS, THEY ARE BOTH A CHOICE FOR GOD TO MAKE. LET’S WALK ARM IN ARM FOR THE REST OF TIME DOWN SIDEWALKS IN EVERY SEASON. 
    <br><br>
    AMERICAN SOCIETY HAS ALWAYS REWARDED MORAL CORRUPTION AND PUNISHED MORAL INTEGRITY.  I WOULD RATHER BE MORALLY GOOD THAN MORALLY CORRUPT. I BELIEVE THAT TO BE MORALLY GOOD IS HONORABLE. MORAL CORRUPTION IS THE AMERICAN ORIGINAL SIN. 
    <br><br>
    FINANCIAL WOES AS OF A MURMUR OF BIRDS IN MY HEART AND A BARELY SUBCONSCIOUS HATRED OF THE WORLD. AWARD MYSELF WITH A MENTAL VACATION FROM THE PROBLEM SINCE THE SEAS ARE TOO CHOPPY TO STAY THE COURSE. BUT I DO. THERE IS ONLY FORWARD IN LIFE. A VALIANT HEART PULLS ME UP AND BRUSHES MY SHOULDERS, TELLS ME IT’S JUST MONEY. IT WILL BE ALRIGHT. 
    <br><br>
    ARTISTS HAVE A VITAL FUNCTION IN SOCIETY. THEY SHAPE THE FUTURE. THEY REVEAL THE PAST. THEY ORGANIZE AND PETITION FOR SOCIAL WORKS. THEY SHOW US THAT THERE IS BEAUTY IN PLACES MOST PEOPLE THINK THERE SHOULDN'T BE. THEY GIVE US HOPE. THEIR CREATIVITY CHANGES SOCIETY. MY FAMILY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT ART IS IMPORTANT AND ARTISTS HAVE TO WORK HARD AS ANYONE ELSE TO MAKE MONEY BUT PROBABLY ENJOY DOING IT 10x MORE THAN THE AVERAGE WORKER.
    <br><br>
    TREES IN A FOREST WORK AS OXYGEN SUPPLIERS, HOMES FOR WILDLIFE, AND SUPPORT AN UNDERGROUND NETWORK ALONG WITH MYCELLIUM. IT'S AN ORGANICALLY DESIGNED FLOORPLAN WHERE THE MYCELLIUM BOTH FERTILIZE THE TREES AS THEY DECOMPOSE LIFE AND FRUIT THEMSELVES TO BE EATEN. THE TREES ATTEMPT TO GROW AS LARGE AS THEY CAN UNDISTURBED, BUT WILL CHANGE GROWTH PATTERN IF LACK OF RESOURCE IS AVAILABLE, INCLUDING SPACE. RECENTLY I HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHY WE AS A CIVILIZATION ARE SO BAD AT MANAGING LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE. WHY ELSE TO HAVE CLASS HEIRARCHIES AND ANYONE AT THE TOP IF NOT TO CONTROL SOCIETY? THAT MEANS THE CONTROLLED GROUP HAS THE DILUSION OF FREE AUTONOMY AND ONLY THE ONES IN CONTROL ARE AUTONOMOUS. CONTROL LIKE RUSSIAN DOLLS ALMOST. TRUE AUTONOMY, WHICH CAN OCCUR IN CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS WITHIN OUR STILL HIERARCHICAL SOCIETY, IS WHEN HUMANS AND NATURE WORK IN COOPERATION AND NO CONTROL IS APPLIED BETWEEN SOCIETAL INDIVIDUALS.

    MOTHER NEEDED AN UBER TO CARRY HER TO MOSCOW. SHE MADE HERSELF THE DEVIL FOR 100 RUBLES. THE KREMLIN INQUIRED UPON HER ARRIVAL. SHE SAID HER TROUPE WAS READY TO PERFORM FOR PUTIN. THE ACTOR PLAYED THE PART FACSIMILE TO HIS LIFE AS A SUPER SOLIDER. THEIR CHEKOV MADE HIM CRY FOR THE OLD WORLD. THEY WERE SHOWN THE TOWN MADE FROM QUIK CRETE. BRUTALIST APARTMENTS SIZED CITY BLOCKS. NO TREES AT ALL, BUT A PLAYGROUND AND AN ARCADE. PARKING LOTS BESIDE FIELDS OF GRASS TO THE HORIZON. THE COLLEGE AT THE CENTER HAD LAWN ON ALL FOUR SIDES. GUSTS BLOW WAVES OVER THE GRASS ON BRIGHT SUMMER DAYS. A RADIO TOWER ON THE STATION BUILDING EMITS THE DEEP HOUSE MUSIC ACROSS THE SKY. 
    <br><br>
    EVERYONE FROM MY TOWN HAS SPENT TIME IN NYC. THEY WENT FOR THE PRESTIGIOUS SCHOOLS THEY NEEDED, AND THEY WENT FOR ACTING AND MUSIC. THEY WENT FOR THE CITY OF THEIR MOTHERS, TO BROOKLYN AND THE EAST SIDE. I’VE VISITED NEW YORK CITY SEVERAL TIMES. I NO LONGER WANT TO STAY THERE THE WAY I DID AT TWENTY, KNOWING BETTER (AND CHEAPER) TO STAY IN THE MIDWEST. I MISS PROSPECT PARK, HANGING OUT IN BROOKLYN AND THE WEST SIDE DURING SUMMER. I JUST DON’T YEARN FOR A BIG CITY ANYMORE. I WANT PEACE AND NATURE AND QUIET LIVING.

    THE CORPORATE FOOD MAFIA IS REAL. 
    <br><br>
    THE BILLBOARD CIGARETTE GLOWED WITH AMBER INCANDESCENCE, THE RED FILM PEELING OFF, THE ENJOYER’S FACE FADED IN LIFE COLOUR, BETWEEN THE FIELD AND THE HIGHWAY. THREE MEN LEFT THE SHOP AND GATHERED IN THE PARKING LOT AGAIN TO DISCUSS THEIR WEEKEND PLANS. THE STREET LIFE BEGAN SPARKING UP PAST CLOSING HOUR, THE NEON ILLUMINATING THE PLEASURE CENTERS JUST PAST SUNSET. THE TOUR BUS ROLLED DOWN THE STRIP IN THE EARLY MORNING BEFORE SUNRISE. THE CREW STOPPED FOR COFFEE AT A LOCAL DINER OUTSIDE GREENVILLE. 
    <br><br>
    IF I CAN RECOUNT THE ERA OF 2006 TO 2013 AS A NOTABLE ERA FOR MUSIC IT WOULD START WITH DEATH CAB (FOR CUTIE). BEING 16 IN O.C. I WAS TRANSFIXED ON THE INTERNET GOOP THAT SEEMED EVERYWHERE AND THE MICROCOSM UNIVERSES OF INDIE ROCK SPRINGING UP ON MTV AND VH1. THE MIDWEST HAD IT’S SUCCESSES IN THE INDIE SPHERE - AND THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY PLAYED HOST TO GOOD SHOWS AT FANCY VENUES ALL THROUGH THE TIME OF THE BIG NYC INDIE ROCK COME UP. BUT SEATTLE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY, AND BANDS LIKE DCFC AND THE SHINS HAD SONGS IN MY FAVORITE INDIE MOVIES AND TELEVISION SHOWS. THEY WERE WEST COAST NEW AGE INDIE. SURF ROCK AND FOLK PUNK WERE THE INFLUENCES AND LOTS OF THAT MADE IT’S WAY INTO THE NY SCENE AS WELL WHEN EXPERIMENTAL FOLK AND FOLK POP BECAME ALL TOO PREVALENT. PEOPLE MOVED FROM THE MIDWEST TO NYC AND VICE VERSA. THE EXCHANGING OF CHILDHOODS IN DIFFERENT LOCAL TOWNS AND CITIES COLLIDING AND COLLABORATING IN BROOKLYN, THE CENTER OF INDIE MUSIC AND THE HIPSTER SCENE.
